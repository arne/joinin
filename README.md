# joinin

A simple koa-app to let people make events and invite people so they can sign up via their own Telegram-bot.

## Rationale

If you're running any semi-regular activity that requires you to have an overview of the number of participants, it often gets difficult having a good overview. The way you invite potential participants and get feedback from them can often be difficult to manage.

This application let you create your own bot to manage invitations and build a list of the people that have confirmed their participation.

## Functionality

You can set up your own bot on the root namespace of the app. This will let you build a list of people you'd like to invite to events for that bot.
